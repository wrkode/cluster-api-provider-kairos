// drainOwnedMachines enumerates CAPI Machines owned by this KairosControlPlane,
// issues a Delete for any that are not already being deleted, and returns the
// count of Machines that are still present (including those mid-deletion).
// Callers use the remaining count to decide whether to requeue or proceed
// with finalizer removal.
//
// Selection criteria (both must hold):
//
//  1. Machine has the `cluster.x-k8s.io/cluster-name` label matching the
//     cluster-name label on the KCP. Without a cluster-name on the KCP we
//     cannot scope the drain safely, so we return 0 / nil and let the
//     finalizer be removed -- there is nothing we can act on.
//  2. Machine's controlling OwnerReference Kind=="KairosControlPlane" AND
//     UID matches the KCP's UID. Matching by UID (not just Name) prevents a
//     foreign Machine with the same name from being deleted if the KCP was
//     recreated. Foreign-owned Machines (different UID or different Kind)
//     are deliberately NOT deleted and NOT counted in `remaining` -- they
//     are not ours to drain.
//
// `IsNotFound` from Delete is treated as success (the Machine was already
// reaped between List and Delete). The CAPI Machine controller is
// responsible for cascading to KairosConfig and the infrastructure Machine
// via OwnerReferences, so this function does not delete those directly.

// pauses CAPI termination after drain, and nothing on the delete path drives the

// teardown (load-bearing). It strips UNCONDITIONALLY — including Machines already
// mid-deletion and paused at the hook — so a scale-down that was in flight when
// the cluster was deleted is unblocked too. Whole-cluster teardown discards etcd
// entirely, so a clean per-member leave is pointless here.
