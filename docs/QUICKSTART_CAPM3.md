# Quick Start Guide - CAPM3 (Metal3 / bare metal)

Last verified against: Kairos v3.6.0+, Kairos Hadron v0.0.4, CAPI v1.13.3, CAPM3 v1.13.0, BMO v0.13.0, provider v0.1.0-beta.1. Verified on emulated bare metal (sushy-tools Redfish BMC + libvirt/KVM) and on physical hardware (Hadron whole-disk deploy to bare metal); the same flow applies to physical hardware with a Redfish/IPMI BMC.

This guide walks you through creating a single-node k3s or k0s cluster on Kairos using Cluster API with the Metal3 infrastructure provider (CAPM3). k0s and k3s use the identical flow and differ only in distribution and version fields. For a 3-node HA control plane, see [High-Availability control plane](#high-availability-control-plane) below.

**Scope of this guide:**

- The single-node walkthrough below provisions `replicas: 1`. HA (`replicas: 3`/`5`) is supported on CAPM3 for both k0s and k3s — see [High-Availability control plane](#high-availability-control-plane).
- DHCP-only networking. Static IPAM via Metal3DataTemplate / Metal3IPPool is a future phase.
- No cloud controller manager (`cloudProviderEnabled: false`). Node providerID is set by the Kairos cloud-config at first boot — no manual patching required.

**Note on `controlPlaneEndpoint`**: both `Cluster.spec.controlPlaneEndpoint` and `Metal3Cluster.spec.controlPlaneEndpoint` must be set to the control-plane node's stable IP:6443 before applying the manifest. The provider does not auto-discover the endpoint. In DHCP-only Phase 1, this is the node's DHCP-assigned data-plane IP. To make this stable, set a DHCP reservation tied to the BareMetalHost's MAC address before applying. If you apply without a valid endpoint, `KairosControlPlane` stalls with `Available=False(WaitingForInfrastructureControlPlaneEndpoint)`.

## How bare-metal provisioning works with CAPM3

Understanding the provisioning model prevents the most common failure modes:

1. You register a physical server as a `BareMetalHost` (BMH) with baremetal-operator. BMO + Ironic inspect the host and mark it `available`.
2. CAPM3 claims the host when you apply a `Metal3Machine` that matches it.
3. Ironic performs a **whole-disk deploy**: it writes the raw disk image you provide directly to the node's boot disk over the provisioning network.
4. Ironic appends a config-drive partition (label `config-2`) containing the Kairos cloud-config rendered by the bootstrap provider.
5. The node UEFI-boots from the disk. The Kairos active system reads the cloud-config from the config-drive and provisions k3s/k0s.

There is no installer step. The disk image you provide must already be a fully installed Kairos system. This is different from the CAPK (KubeVirt) 2-disk installer pattern.

---

## Building the disk image

This is the most important prerequisite. Ironic deploys a raw disk image. That image must contain an already-installed Kairos OS — not an installer ISO and not an auroraboot auto-reset image.

### Why an auroraboot `disk.raw` does not work

An auroraboot `disk.raw` (recovery / auto-reset image) is designed to auto-reset-install on first boot. Its first-boot repartitioning collides with the `config-2` partition Ironic appends as the config-drive. The node boots into `cos-recovery` (an ephemeral overlay) instead of the persistent active system. k3s / k0s then fails with an `overlay not supported as upperdir` error and never provisions a working node.

### Hadron images: additional failure mode

Kairos Hadron is the next-generation Kairos OS (musl-libc based). When a Hadron image that has not been fully installed is deployed via Ironic, the failure is different from the standard Kairos `cos-recovery` case described above:

- `kairos-agent` reports `boot_mode=recovery_boot` on the node.
- k0scontroller stays `disabled`; `/etc/k0s` and `/var/lib/k0s` are never created.
- k3s similarly never starts.
- The CAPI Machine stays `Provisioning` indefinitely.

This occurs because an `auroraboot build-iso` product (or `auroraboot disk.raw`) produces an image with a populated `recovery` partition but no `state` (active) partition. Ironic writes it to disk; the node boots into recovery mode rather than the active system.

The fix is the same as for standard Kairos: build a fully-installed disk. The supported pipeline for Hadron:

1. Build the Hadron ISO with `auroraboot`:
   ```bash
   auroraboot build-iso -n <name> docker:<hadron-image>
   # e.g.: docker:quay.io/kairos/hadron:v0.0.4-standard-amd64-generic-v4.0.3-k3s-v1.35.2-k3s1
   ```
2. Boot that ISO in QEMU against a blank 20 G raw disk with an install cloud-config (same QEMU procedure described below), allowing Kairos to install and power off.
3. Verify with `losetup`: the `state` partition (label `state`) must be present alongside `recovery`.
4. Serve the resulting `<name>-installed.raw` + `.md5` from the Ironic httpd.

**Quick verification before serving the image:**

```bash
sudo losetup -fP <name>-installed.raw
# Note the device printed, e.g. /dev/loop0
sudo blkid /dev/loop0p*
# A correctly-installed Hadron disk has both a "state" and a "recovery" partition.
# If you only see "recovery" (no "state"), the image was not fully installed.
sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0
```

The same verification applies to standard Kairos images: `COS_ACTIVE` corresponds to `state`, `COS_PERSISTENT` is the data partition.

### Required: a fully-installed Kairos raw disk

The image you provide must have `COS_ACTIVE`, `COS_PERSISTENT`, `COS_OEM`, and `COS_STATE` partition labels already present (or for Hadron: `efi`, `oem`, `persistent`, `recovery`, `state`). The node boots straight into the active, persistent system and reads the config-drive.

### Producing the image: QEMU install-to-disk

The supported method uses a Kairos installer ISO to install onto a blank raw disk in QEMU. The result is the fully-installed disk image.

**Inputs required:**

- A Kairos installer ISO at the exact k3s or k0s version you intend to run. Example filename:
  `kairos-ubuntu-24.04-standard-amd64-generic-v3.6.0-k3sv1.33.5+k3s1.iso`
- `qemu-system-x86_64` with KVM, OVMF firmware, and `genisoimage`.

**Step 1: Write a minimal install cloud-config.**

Create `user-data`:

```yaml
#cloud-config
install:
  auto: true
  device: /dev/vda
  poweroff: true   # powers off QEMU when install completes
users:
  - name: kairos
    groups:
      - admin
    passwd: kairos   # temporary; only used during the install VM session
    ssh_authorized_keys: []
```

Create `meta-data`:

```yaml
instance-id: kairos-install
local-hostname: kairos-install
```

Pack them into a cidata ISO:

```bash
genisoimage -output cidata.iso \
  -volid cidata \
  -joliet -rock \
  user-data meta-data
```

**Step 2: Create a blank raw disk.**

Size the disk to match or be smaller than the node's physical disk, with margin:

```bash
qemu-img create -f raw kairos-installed.raw 20G
```

**Step 3: Boot QEMU headless and let the installer run.**

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -enable-kvm \
  -cpu host \
  -machine q35 \
  -m 4096 \
  -drive file=/path/to/OVMF_CODE.fd,if=pflash,format=raw,readonly=on \
  -drive file=kairos-installed.raw,if=virtio,format=raw \
  -drive file=/path/to/kairos-installer.iso,media=cdrom \
  -drive file=cidata.iso,media=cdrom \
  -boot order=cd \
  -no-reboot \
  -nographic
```

Replace `/path/to/OVMF_CODE.fd` with your OVMF firmware path (commonly `/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd` or `/usr/share/edk2/ovmf/OVMF_CODE.fd`).

`install.poweroff: true` causes the Kairos installer to power off QEMU when installation completes. `-no-reboot` is a safety net. The QEMU process exits when the install finishes; this typically takes 3–10 minutes depending on disk speed.

**Step 4: Verify the partition layout.**

```bash
sudo losetup -fP kairos-installed.raw
# Note the device name printed, e.g. /dev/loop0
sudo blkid /dev/loop0p*
# Standard Kairos — expect labels: COS_ACTIVE, COS_PERSISTENT, COS_OEM, COS_STATE
# Hadron — expect labels:          efi, oem, persistent, recovery, state
sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0
```

For standard Kairos: if `COS_ACTIVE` and `COS_PERSISTENT` are not present, the install did not complete.

For Hadron: if `state` is not present (only `recovery` is visible), the image is an installer/live image, not a fully-installed disk. Do not use it with Ironic — the node will boot into recovery mode and k0s/k3s will never start.

**Step 5: Generate checksums and serve over HTTP.**

```bash
md5sum kairos-installed.raw > kairos-installed.raw.md5
# or for sha256:
# sha256sum kairos-installed.raw > kairos-installed.raw.sha256
```

Serve both files from an HTTP server reachable from the Ironic provisioning network:

```bash
# Simple example using Python; use a production-grade server for real deployments.
python3 -m http.server 6180 --directory /path/to/images/
```

The `Metal3MachineTemplate.spec.template.spec.image.url` and `.checksum` fields point at these URLs.

### Version pinning

The k3s or k0s version is fixed at image-build time. `KairosControlPlane.spec.version` and `KairosConfigTemplate.spec.kubernetesVersion` are informational on the Metal3 whole-disk path — they do not change what runs on the node. Set both fields to match the version bundled in the image you built. If there is a mismatch, CAPI may report incorrect version information and future upgrade tooling will not work correctly.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Bare-metal environment**:
   - Physical or emulated servers with IPMI, Redfish, or iDRAC BMC access.
   - Ironic and baremetal-operator v0.13+ deployed and accessible from the management cluster.
   - A DHCP server on the provisioning network, or pre-assigned IP addresses.
   - An HTTP server serving the disk image and its checksum, reachable from the provisioning network.

2. **Management cluster**: A Kubernetes cluster with network access to the Ironic API and to the workload nodes.

3. **Cluster API core**: v1.13.3+ required (v1beta2 contract). CAPM3 v1.13 stores its CRDs at the `v1beta2` contract, so the management cluster's CAPI core must serve `v1beta2`. (This provider's typed client additionally relies on `cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1` still being served; CAPI continues to serve both, so no action is needed.) The manifests in this guide are authored in `v1beta2`. Verify:
   ```bash
   kubectl api-versions | grep cluster.x-k8s.io
   ```

4. **CAPM3**: Cluster API Provider Metal3 v1.13+ installed.
   ```bash
   kubectl get crd metal3clusters.infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io
   ```

5. **Kairos CAPI Provider**: v0.1.0-beta.1+ installed (see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)).

6. **Fully-installed Kairos disk image**: See "Building the disk image" above.

7. **BareMetalHost registered**: At least one `BareMetalHost` in `available` state. BMO must have inspected it successfully:
   ```bash
   kubectl get baremetalhosts -A
   # Look for provisioning state "available"
   ```

### Installing CAPM3

Install CAPM3 using `clusterctl` or the upstream manifests. Refer to the [Metal3 documentation](https://book.metal3.io/capm3/introduction) for the current install procedure. The Kairos CAPI provider is installed separately:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kairos-io/cluster-api-provider-kairos/releases/download/v0.1.0-beta.1/kairos-capi-provider.yaml
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for the full provider install and verification steps.

---

## Creating a Cluster

### Step 1: Register your BareMetalHost

If you have not already registered the target server, create the BMC credentials Secret and `BareMetalHost` object. Templates for both are included (commented out) in the sample manifest. The BareMetalHost `spec.online: true` allows BMO to inspect and then provision the host.

```bash
# Edit the commented-out sections at the bottom of the sample manifest,
# then apply:
kubectl apply -f config/samples/capm3/kairos_cluster_k3s_single_node.yaml
```

Wait for the host to reach `available` state before proceeding:

```bash
kubectl get baremetalhosts -w
# Provisioning state transitions: registering → inspecting → available
```

### Step 2: Create the user-password Secret

```bash
kubectl create secret generic kairos-user-password \
  --from-literal=password=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

The sample manifests reference this Secret via `userPasswordSecretRef`. Do not set `userPassword` inline.

### Step 3: Choose a sample manifest

- k3s single node: `config/samples/capm3/kairos_cluster_k3s_single_node.yaml`
- k0s single node: `config/samples/capm3/kairos_cluster_k0s_single_node.yaml`

### Step 4: Customize the manifest

Open the chosen sample and fill in all values marked `TODO`.

#### Cluster and Metal3Cluster

```yaml
spec:
  controlPlaneEndpoint:
    host: "192.168.1.100"   # replace with the node's actual or reserved IP
    port: 6443
```

Set the same IP in both `Cluster.spec.controlPlaneEndpoint.host` and `Metal3Cluster.spec.controlPlaneEndpoint.host`.

#### Metal3MachineTemplate

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      image:
        url: "http://192.168.222.2:6180/images/kairos-k3s-installed.raw"
        checksum: "http://192.168.222.2:6180/images/kairos-k3s-installed.raw.md5"
        checksumType: md5    # or sha256 / sha512
        diskFormat: raw
```

The `checksumType` must match the hash algorithm used to produce the checksum file.

#### KairosControlPlane and KairosConfigTemplate

```yaml
# In KairosControlPlane:
spec:
  version: "v1.34.3+k3s3"     # must match the version bundled in your disk image
  distribution: k3s

# In KairosConfigTemplate:
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      distribution: k3s
      kubernetesVersion: "v1.34.3+k3s3"   # must match spec.version above
      # Note: no install: block — Ironic already wrote the OS to disk
```

### Step 5: Apply the manifest

k3s:

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/capm3/kairos_cluster_k3s_single_node.yaml
```

k0s:

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/capm3/kairos_cluster_k0s_single_node.yaml
```

### Step 6: Monitor cluster creation

```bash
kubectl get cluster kairos-m3 -w
kubectl get kairoscontrolplane kairos-m3-cp
kubectl get machines -n default
kubectl get metal3machines -n default
kubectl get baremetalhosts -n default
```

Expected BareMetalHost state progression: `available` → `provisioning` → `provisioned`.

Expected Machine state: `Provisioning` → `Running`.

Provisioning bare metal typically takes 5–20 minutes depending on disk write speed and network bandwidth for the image download.

### Step 7: Retrieve the kubeconfig

```bash
kubectl get secret kairos-m3-kubeconfig \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.value}' | base64 -d > kairos-m3-kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl --kubeconfig=kairos-m3-kubeconfig.yaml get nodes
kubectl --kubeconfig=kairos-m3-kubeconfig.yaml get pods -n kube-system
```

**Node-push behavior:** The control-plane node posts its kubeconfig to a Secret in the management cluster at bootstrap time. The node must have network reachability to the management cluster's API server (`<mgmt-api-server-host>:6443`). See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#network-reachability-requirement-for-non-capk-infrastructure) for verification steps.

If the node cannot reach the management API server, enable the opt-in [Air-gapped fallback (SSHFallback)](#air-gapped-fallback-sshfallback) on the `KairosControlPlane`.

---

## High-Availability control plane

CAPM3 supports a 3- or 5-node control plane fronted by a kube-vip virtual IP (VIP), using [`config/samples/capm3/kairos_cluster_k0s_ha.yaml`](../config/samples/capm3/kairos_cluster_k0s_ha.yaml) or [`kairos_cluster_k3s_ha.yaml`](../config/samples/capm3/kairos_cluster_k3s_ha.yaml). Read the single-node walkthrough above first — the disk-image, BareMetalHost, and credentials-Secret steps are identical. This section covers only what's different for HA.

k0s is the fully-supported HA distribution. k3s HA bring-up works the same way, but replacing a k3s control-plane node afterward leaves an orphaned etcd member requiring manual cleanup (KD-5d) — see [README.md § Day-2](../README.md#day-2-etcd-health-and-quorum-safe-replacement).

### HA prerequisites

In addition to the [single-node prerequisites](#prerequisites):

1. **Three (or five) BareMetalHosts** registered and `available`, instead of one.
2. **A free VIP address** on the nodes' routable network, outside any DHCP pool and not otherwise in use. `Cluster.spec.controlPlaneEndpoint.host` and `Metal3Cluster.spec.controlPlaneEndpoint.host` must equal this VIP, not any individual node's IP.
3. **The NIC name on your Kairos image.** kube-vip advertises the VIP on a specific interface (`spec.ha.vip.interface`); confirm the name with `ip link` on a provisioned node.
4. **Per-node identity via `hostnamePrefix`, not `hostname`.** All control-plane nodes boot from the same disk image; setting an explicit `hostname` collides every Node name. Use `KairosConfigTemplate.spec.template.spec.hostnamePrefix` so each node gets a distinct name.

### Customizing the HA sample

Open the chosen HA sample and fill in the `TODO` placeholders — one BMC-credentials Secret and one `BareMetalHost` per node, plus these HA-specific fields:

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: Cluster
spec:
  controlPlaneEndpoint:
    host: "TODO-REPLACE-WITH-VIP-ADDRESS"   # MUST equal spec.ha.vip.address below
    port: 6443
---
apiVersion: controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: KairosControlPlane
spec:
  replicas: 3               # 3 or 5 only — odd counts for etcd quorum
  distribution: k0s          # or k3s — set explicitly for clarity (see note below)
  ha:
    vip:
      address: "TODO-REPLACE-WITH-VIP-ADDRESS"
      interface: "TODO-NODE-NIC"   # NIC name from `ip link` on a provisioned node
      mode: ARP
```

**Setting `spec.distribution` explicitly on the `KairosControlPlane` is recommended.** An explicit value always wins. If left unset, the controller inherits `spec.distribution` from the referenced `KairosConfigTemplate` (falling back to `k0s` only if neither sets one), so a k3s HA manifest that sets `distribution: k3s` only on the `KairosConfigTemplate` still provisions k3s. Setting it explicitly on both resources removes any ambiguity and is what both HA sample files do; if an explicit `KairosControlPlane` value ever disagrees with the template's, the controller emits a `DistributionOverride` warning Event and the explicit value wins.

### Apply and verify

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/capm3/kairos_cluster_k0s_ha.yaml
kubectl get kairoscontrolplane kairos-m3-ha-cp -w
```

HA comes up successfully when:

```bash
kubectl get kairoscontrolplane kairos-m3-ha-cp \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.readyReplicas}/{.status.replicas}'
# expect: 3/3
```

Check `EtcdHealthy` and confirm the VIP answers the API:

```bash
kubectl get kairoscontrolplane kairos-m3-ha-cp -o yaml | grep -A4 "type: EtcdHealthy"
curl -k https://<vip-address>:6443/livez
```

### HA troubleshooting

Same failure modes as [CAPV HA troubleshooting](QUICKSTART_CAPV.md#ha-troubleshooting) — the `KairosControlPlane`/etcd behavior is provider-independent. Metal3-specific additions:

| Symptom | Cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| All three Nodes register with the same name | `hostname` was set instead of `hostnamePrefix` in the `KairosConfigTemplate` | Switch to `hostnamePrefix`; each node then derives a distinct name from its machine ID. |
| A control-plane node comes up running the wrong distribution | An explicit `KairosControlPlane.spec.distribution` disagrees with the `KairosConfigTemplate`'s (explicit KCP value always wins — check for a `DistributionOverride` warning Event on the `KairosControlPlane`), or the disk image doesn't match the resolved distribution | Set `spec.distribution` explicitly on the `KairosControlPlane` to match the `KairosConfigTemplate`, and confirm the Metal3 image is built for that distribution. |

---

## Field Reference

### Required fields to customize

| Field | Resource | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `spec.controlPlaneEndpoint.host` | Cluster, Metal3Cluster | The control-plane node's stable IP. Set identically in both resources. |
| `spec.controlPlaneEndpoint.port` | Cluster, Metal3Cluster | API server port. Default: 6443. |
| `spec.template.spec.image.url` | Metal3MachineTemplate | HTTP URL of the fully-installed Kairos raw disk image. |
| `spec.template.spec.image.checksum` | Metal3MachineTemplate | HTTP URL of the checksum file (one-line md5sum / sha256sum output). |
| `spec.template.spec.image.checksumType` | Metal3MachineTemplate | Hash algorithm: `md5`, `sha256`, or `sha512`. Must match the checksum file. |
| `spec.version` | KairosControlPlane | k3s/k0s version bundled in the disk image. Informational; must match the image. |
| `spec.template.spec.kubernetesVersion` | KairosConfigTemplate | Same version as above; must match `KairosControlPlane.spec.version`. |
| `spec.template.spec.distribution` | KairosConfigTemplate | `k3s` or `k0s`. Must match `KairosControlPlane.spec.distribution`. |

### Metal3MachineTemplate image fields

| Field | Values | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `diskFormat` | `raw` | Ironic whole-disk deploy; only `raw` is validated for this path. |
| `checksumType` | `md5`, `sha256`, `sha512` | `md5` has the widest Ironic version compatibility; `sha256` is preferred for new deployments. |

### KairosConfigTemplate fields specific to Metal3

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `install` | **Must be absent.** Ironic has already written the OS. Adding an `install:` block causes Kairos to attempt a second install on the provisioned disk. |
| `role` | Set to `control-plane` for the control-plane template. |
| `distribution` | Must match `KairosControlPlane.spec.distribution`. |

### cloudProviderEnabled

`Metal3Cluster.spec.cloudProviderEnabled: false` disables the external cloud controller manager. CAPM3 v1.13 with this setting finds the Kubernetes Node by the `metal3.io/uuid` label and validates `providerID=metal3://<BareMetalHost-UID>` — it does not set them. The Kairos cloud-config sets both automatically from the Ironic config-drive metadata (the `config-2` drive's `meta_data.json` `.uuid`): on **k3s** via a `config.yaml.d` kubelet drop-in applied when the node registers; on **k0s** via a post-bootstrap `kubectl patch` of the node (setting a previously-empty `providerID` is permitted by the API server). Either way, **no manual providerID patching is required** — the node sets it itself.

---

## Kairos Hadron notes

This section covers behavior specific to Kairos Hadron images deployed via Metal3. Hadron is the musl-libc-based next-generation Kairos OS; it shares the same Metal3 provisioning flow but has a few differences from standard (glibc) Kairos images.

### Pinning the control-plane IP

The Metal3 config-drive `network_data` DHCPs the node's data-plane NIC. For single-node clusters where the `controlPlaneEndpoint` host must match a fixed IP, the DHCP-assigned address is non-deterministic and will not automatically match what you set in the manifest.

Two approaches, in preference order:

1. **DHCP reservation** — pin the IP at the network layer, tied to the `BareMetalHost.spec.bootMACAddress`. The IP is stable before first boot and requires no cloud-config changes. This is the most reliable approach.

2. **`spec.files` + systemd-networkd** — write a `.network` unit file matching the data-plane NIC's MAC address and set a static address equal to the `controlPlaneEndpoint` host. The file is delivered via the cloud-config `write_files:` list (see [`KairosConfigTemplate.spec.template.spec.files`](API_REFERENCE.md#writing-files-to-nodes)).

   Example `KairosConfigTemplate` snippet:

   ```yaml
   spec:
     template:
       spec:
         files:
           - path: /etc/systemd/network/10-cp.network
             content: |
               [Match]
               MACAddress=aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
   
               [Network]
               Address=192.168.1.100/24
               Gateway=192.168.1.1
               DNS=192.168.1.1
             permissions: "0644"
             owner: "root:root"
   ```

   Replace `MACAddress`, `Address`, `Gateway`, and `DNS` with your network's values. The `MACAddress=` match key is more reliable than an interface name on bare metal where NIC names can vary by firmware.

   **Caveat:** this is the same static-IP race condition described in the API reference. On a pre-installed disk image, systemd-networkd may already hold a DHCP lease when the file lands. The static IP takes effect after the next `networkctl reload`; if k0s or k3s has already bound the DHCP address, the running process will not switch addresses until the node is rebooted. The DHCP reservation approach avoids this race entirely. See [Writing files to nodes — Static IP via systemd-networkd](API_REFERENCE.md#static-ip-via-systemd-networkd--known-limitation-on-pre-installed-images) for the full explanation.

### Hadron `write_files` file ownership (musl compatibility)

Kairos Hadron uses musl-libc, which resolves file ownership by name rather than by numeric UID/GID. The provider emits `owner: root` (by name) in all `write_files:` entries, not `owner: 0` (by UID). This is the correct behavior for Hadron and is also accepted by glibc-based Kairos images. If you author your own `spec.files` entries, use `owner: "root:root"` (name form) — numeric owners such as `"0:0"` are rejected by the webhook and would fail on Hadron regardless.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Node stays in provisioning; BareMetalHost stays in `provisioning` state

```bash
kubectl describe baremetalhost kairos-m3-node-0 -n default
kubectl logs -n baremetal-operator-system deployment/baremetal-operator
```

Common causes:

1. **Image server unreachable from Ironic**: verify Ironic can reach the HTTP server. The image URL is resolved from the Ironic pod, not the management cluster's API server.
2. **Checksum mismatch**: regenerate with `md5sum <image>` and verify the `.md5` file content is exactly `<hash>  <filename>` (two spaces between hash and name — standard `md5sum` output format).
3. **Wrong `checksumType`**: `checksumType: md5` with a sha256 file (or vice versa) causes Ironic to reject the image silently. Match the type to the algorithm used.
4. **BMC credentials wrong or BMC unreachable**: verify IPMI/Redfish connectivity:
   ```bash

### Node provisions but k3s/k0s never starts; logs show `overlay not supported as upperdir`

This means an auroraboot auto-reset image was deployed instead of a fully-installed disk. Re-read the "Building the disk image" section. The `cos-recovery` partition is an ephemeral overlay and cannot host a persistent upper directory. Re-provision with a correctly-built image.

### Node provisions (Hadron) but Machine stays `Provisioning`; `kairos-agent` reports `boot_mode=recovery_boot`

This is the Hadron-specific form of the same root cause. On a Hadron image that has not been fully installed, `kairos-agent` reports `boot_mode=recovery_boot` at boot. The consequences:

- `k0scontroller` stays `disabled`; `/etc/k0s` and `/var/lib/k0s` are never created.
- k3s similarly does not start.
- The CAPI Machine stays in `Provisioning` indefinitely with no further error.

Check this condition on the node (via console or SSHFallback):

```bash
kairos-agent status | grep boot_mode
# boot_mode=recovery_boot  →  wrong image
# boot_mode=active_boot    →  correct image
```

Also check the partition table:

```bash
lsblk -o NAME,LABEL
# "state" partition absent → image was not fully installed
```

Reprovision with a fully-installed Hadron disk. See the "Hadron images: additional failure mode" subsection under "Building the disk image" above for the build pipeline.

### Node provisions but `KubeconfigReadyCondition` stays `False(WaitingForNodePush)`

The node k3s/k0s is running but the kubeconfig has not reached the management cluster. Causes:

1. **No network route from the node to the management cluster API server**: run `curl -k https://<mgmt-api-server-host>:6443/api` from the node. If it fails, either open the network path or enable [SSHFallback](#air-gapped-fallback-sshfallback).
2. **bootstrap-Secret naming**: if `BareMetalHost.spec.userData` references a Secret that does not exist, upgrade the provider to v0.1.0-alpha.2+. The deterministic bootstrap-Secret naming fix shipped in alpha.2 and is required for unattended Metal3 provisioning.

### Bootstrap issues

```bash
kubectl describe kairosconfig <config-name>
kubectl logs -n kairos-capi-system deployment/kairos-capi-controller-manager
```

If `KairosConfig.status.failureMessage` is set, the issue is transient — it clears when resolved. A missing `kairos-user-password` Secret is the most common first-run cause.

### Metal3Cluster not becoming ready

```bash
kubectl describe metal3cluster kairos-m3
kubectl logs -n capm3-system deployment/capm3-controller-manager
```

Verify that `cloudProviderEnabled: false` is set. With `cloudProviderEnabled: true` (the default), CAPM3 expects a cloud controller manager to be running, which will never be satisfied in this configuration.

### controlPlaneEndpoint not resolving

If the node's IP changes after provisioning (DHCP lease reassignment), the `controlPlaneEndpoint` becomes stale. Prevention: set a DHCP reservation tied to the BareMetalHost MAC address. Recovery requires updating both `Cluster.spec.controlPlaneEndpoint.host` and `Metal3Cluster.spec.controlPlaneEndpoint.host` and restarting the node's API server with the correct bind address.

## Security Considerations

- **BMC credentials**: store in a `kubernetes.io/opaque` Secret in the same namespace as the BareMetalHost. Do not set BMC credentials inline anywhere. The sample manifest shows the correct pattern.
- **User password**: provide via `userPasswordSecretRef`. The webhook rejects `KairosConfig` objects with no credential. Do not set `userPassword` inline outside of throwaway testing.
- **Image integrity**: use `checksumType: sha256` (or sha512) in production. md5 is shown in samples for compatibility; it is not a security-grade algorithm. Ironic verifies the checksum before deploying.
- **Image server**: serve disk images over HTTPS if the provisioning network is not isolated. An unauthenticated HTTP image server on a shared network allows image substitution.
- **SSH access**: add `sshPublicKey` or `githubUser` to `KairosConfigTemplate` if you need direct node access. Password-based SSH should not be the primary access mechanism.
- **Provisioning network**: treat the Ironic provisioning network as a trusted, isolated segment. Ironic PXE-boots nodes on this network; a compromised provisioning network allows arbitrary OS injection.

## Next Steps

- Configure worker nodes via `MachineDeployment` with a `Metal3MachineTemplate` and a worker-role `KairosConfigTemplate`.
- Add custom Kubernetes manifests via `spec.template.spec.manifests` in `KairosConfigTemplate`.
- HA control planes (`replicas: 3`/`5` with a kube-vip VIP via `spec.ha.vip`) are supported on CAPM3 for both k0s and k3s — see [High-Availability control plane](#high-availability-control-plane) above and the [README HA section](../README.md#high-availability-control-planes).
- Static IPAM via Metal3DataTemplate / Metal3IPPool is a future phase.

## Air-gapped fallback (SSHFallback)

**When to use:** the bare-metal node has no network route to the management cluster API server (`<mgmt-api-server-host>:6443`). The node-push path — where the node POSTs its kubeconfig to a management cluster Secret — is unreachable. Without this fallback, `KubeconfigReadyCondition` stays `False(WaitingForNodePush)` indefinitely.

**When NOT to use:** the default node-push path works in most networks. Do not enable SSHFallback unless you have confirmed the node cannot reach the management API server. The fallback is an escape hatch, not a replacement for node-push.

**Security requirement:** host-key verification is mandatory. The controller verifies the workload node's SSH host key against a `known_hosts` Secret before any data is exchanged. There is no trust-on-first-use mode. `activateAfter` must be at least 15 minutes (greater than the `KubeconfigReadyCondition` Info→Warning threshold of 10 minutes).

### Step 1: Create the SSH identity Secret

```bash
kubectl create secret generic kairos-ssh-identity \
  --type=kubernetes.io/ssh-auth \
  --from-file=ssh-privatekey=/path/to/your/private_key \
  -n default
```

The corresponding public key must already be installed on the node via `KairosConfigTemplate.spec.template.spec.sshPublicKey` or `githubUser`.

### Step 2: Create the known-hosts Secret

Obtain the node's SSH host key while you still have network access (or from the Kairos image's pre-generated host key material):

```bash
ssh-keyscan <node-ip> > known_hosts_file
kubectl create secret generic kairos-ssh-known-hosts \
  --from-file=known_hosts=known_hosts_file \
  -n default
```

### Step 3: Enable SSHFallback on the KairosControlPlane

```yaml
spec:
  sshFallback:
    enabled: true
    user: kairos          # must match the node's SSH user
    port: 22
    activateAfter: 15m    # must exceed kubeconfigReadyTimeout (10m)
    identitySecretRef:
      name: kairos-ssh-identity
    knownHostsSecretRef:
      name: kairos-ssh-known-hosts
```

Both Secrets must be in the same namespace as the `KairosControlPlane`. The webhook rejects cross-namespace references.

### Step 4: Verify activation

```bash
kubectl describe kairoscontrolplane kairos-m3-cp -n default
```

The `KubeconfigReadyCondition` Reason tells you which path is active:

| Reason | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `KubeconfigReady` | Node-push succeeded. SSHFallback did not fire. |
| `KubeconfigReadyViaSSHFallback` | SSH fallback supplied the kubeconfig. |
| `SSHFallbackDialing` | SSH fallback is in progress; wait up to 30 seconds. |
| `SSHFallbackFailed` | SSH attempt failed. Check Events for the categorized error. |
| `SSHFallbackMisconfigured` | A referenced Secret is missing, empty, or unparseable. Fix the Secret; the controller retries automatically. |

## Cleanup

```bash
kubectl delete -f config/samples/capm3/kairos_cluster_k3s_single_node.yaml
```

Deleting the `Cluster` object triggers CAPM3 to deprovision the `BareMetalHost` (power off and wipe the provisioned state). The `BareMetalHost` object itself is not deleted by CAPI — it returns to `available` state for reuse. Delete the `BareMetalHost` manually if you want to deregister the server from BMO:

```bash
kubectl delete baremetalhost kairos-m3-node-0 -n default
```
